# Agenda
- simulation / topology discussion
	- diodes stressed differently depending on the rectifier or inverter mode
	- modulation for single phase?
	- DUT is whichever leg we want
	- understand diode losses

- HW+lab plan
	- temperature measurement to get losses, calibrate first
	- hb independent

- WPP for lab
	- new wpp for scope

- control card
	- ask szymon
	- Qspice

- ga2o3 samples -> by the end of march BCS
	- masaki has quote, we dont know when we'll get them

- DPT
	- Nianzun SPT -> very fancy IV (high power)
	- Doing all that manually -> inconvenient
	- She's applying for researcher's business grant

- WiPDA
	- next week, probably two papers (one temperature dependance one APD)
